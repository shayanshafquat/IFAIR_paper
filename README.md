## Overview
1. Learned a generalized data representation, preserving fairness-aware similarity between individual records
2. Developed the combined objective function involving utility and fairness loss and minimized that using L-BFGS 
3. Applied the method on two classification tasks of Census and German credit dataset with gender, and age as protected groups resulting in a gain of 3%, 9% in consistency (fairness), and a drop of 7% and 1% respectively
